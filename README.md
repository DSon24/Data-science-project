## Project Overview:

This project develops a highly accurate binary classifier that predicts whether a Netflix title is a Movie or a TV Show using only four basic metadata features: 

- Production country

- Release year

-  Content rating

- Duration (minutes or seasons)

A simple Logistic Regression model achieves 100% accuracy, 100% precision, 100% recall, and 100% F1-score on the held-out test set (1,594 samples). The near-perfect performance is driven by the strong structural difference in duration formatting (minutes vs. seasons).

The project also includes exploratory analysis of genre frequency and its evolution across three distinct eras (1942–1979, 1980–1989, 1990–2021), highlighting Netflix’s shift toward global and TV-centric content.
